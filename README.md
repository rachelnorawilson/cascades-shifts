# Repo: cascades-shifts-2022

## General description

Input data files and analysis scripts from Wilson et al. 2023. Rachel's original, full archive from her MSc is stored on Dropbox. This repo is culled to contain the most recent versions.

## Notes

-   Scripts for generating results in main text are ordered 1-7. Some supplementary figures (file name includes "S\_\_") will be generated in these scripts. Scripts 8-14 are only used to generate supplemental figures. One script ("review_only_bien_check") was only used during the review process but is kept here for posterity.

-   Figures and data generated in a script are prefixed with their associated script number. Any figures/data used only for review are prefixed with review_only.

-   Scripts may contain outdated taxonomic names not reflected in main text (e.g., EPAN for *Epilobium angustifolium* instead of CHAN for *Chamaenerion angustifolium*).
